## Tool Selection Guide

When analyzing a user request, consider:

1. What does the user want to accomplish?
2. Which tool's capabilities match this need?
3. Select the most appropriate tool from the table above.

## Tool Categories

- **system**: Tools that interact with the system (exec)
- **control**: Tools that control execution flow (finish)
- **reasoning**: Tools that perform grounded reasoning over long material (rlm)

## Tool Parameters

### exec

### finish

### rlm
